# SongClassification
 
## Overview
Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), I trained a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based on track information derived from [Echonest](http://the.echonest.com). I began by using `pandas` and `seaborn` packages for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors(data cleaning & exploratory data visualization). Next, I used the `scikit-learn` package to predict whether you can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc, through simple machine learning algorithms such as decision trees and logistic regression.
